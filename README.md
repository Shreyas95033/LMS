My app name/project name is Library Management System.

Project Description : 

The Library Management System In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project contains only the admin side. The admin side does all the management like adding and managing categories, authors, books, issued books, and so on. Thus, this is a digital way of management of the library system.
The project file contains a python script (Main.py, Borrow.py, Return.py, dt.py, ListSplit.py) and a text file(stock.txt). This is a simple console-base project which is very easy to understand and use. Also, this project makes it easy for the library to keep the records of books, borrowing and returning of books in a digital way.

Azure web apps service : 

Azure App Service, one of the Azure products, is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides all the tools and services needed to create reliable and scalable mission-critical Web Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, and Logic Apps in a single instance. One of its components, Azure Web Apps is a fully managed service that helps to develop and deploy enterprise-ready web applications. It provides powerful capabilities such as built-in development operations, continuous integration with Visual Studio Online and GitHub, staging and production support, and automatic patching for Azure developers to quick create web applications. It also enables integration with on-premises or other cloud systems.


I have used Microsoft azure web apps services for deployment of my code in github repository. I have created a resourse of web app and deployed in central us location with python runtime stack and created a resource. Then I selected deployment centre and selected github for my deployment of my code. After selecting github I deployed and build my code in my github repository in my "main" branch and run all the tests with success resulting in the succesfull completion of my code testing and running.
To download my project just go to "actions" and select app build and in the artifacts section you will be able to see "python app" just click it and my project will be downloaded.
