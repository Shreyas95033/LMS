The Library Management System In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project contains only the admin side. The admin side does all the management like adding and managing categories, authors, books, issued books, and so on. Thus, this is a digital way of management of the library system.
The project file contains a python script (Main.py, Borrow.py, Return.py, dt.py, ListSplit.py) and a text file(stock.txt). This is a simple console-base project which is very easy to understand and use. Also, this project makes it easy for the library to keep the records of books, borrowing and returning of books in a digital way.

I have used Microsoft web apps for deployment of my code in github repository. I have created a resourse of web app and deployed in central us location with python runtime stack
and created a resource. Then I selected deployment centre and selected github for my deployment of my code. After selecting github I deployed and build my code in my github repository in my "main" branch and run all the tests with success resulting in the succesfull completion of my code testing and running.
To download my project just go to "actions" and select app build and in the artifacts section you will be able to see "python app" just click it and my project will be downloaded.
I am also sharing the video as an evidence of my azure service used of my personal azure account "pshreyas950@gmail.com" :
